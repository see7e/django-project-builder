# Django Project Builder

This maybe in the future I'll split in a different project, but for now as it's still small I'll keep it here.

Need installed `tqdm`, run:

```bash
pip install tqdm
python setup.py
```

It will ask for the project name and some configurations:

- Enter the name of the Django project:
- Enter the type of database to use (postgresql/mysql/sqlite):
- Enter the Docker image to use (python/ubuntu):
